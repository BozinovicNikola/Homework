        <p>Did a full 180, crazy
        Thinking 'bout the way I was
        Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
        But look at where I ended up
        I'm all good already
        So moved on, it's scary
        I'm not where you left me at all, so></p>
        <p>If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
        If you wanna believe that anything could stop me</p>
        <p>Don't show up, don't come out
        Don't start caring about me now
        Walk away, you know how
        Don't start caring about me now</p>
        <p>Aren't you the guy who tried to
        Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
        Though it took some time to survive you
        I'm better on the other side
        I'm all good already
        So moved on, it's scary
        I'm not where you left me at all, so</p>

        And you're making the typical me break my typical rules
